**MySQL Database Fundamentals Practice**

This repository showcases practical application of fundamental SQL (Structured Query Language) concepts for relational databases, specifically using MySQL. It includes a variety of queries and schema definitions designed to reinforce understanding of database interaction and best practices.

Key Concepts Covered:

Database Definition Language (DDL): Understanding how to create and manage database schemas, tables, and define relationships using primary and foreign keys.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): Proficiency in querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

Data Retrieval (SELECT statements):

Selecting specific columns vs. all columns (*).

Applying conditions and filtering results using WHERE clauses (including AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, IN, IS NULL).

Sorting data (ORDER BY) and limiting result sets (LIMIT).

Utilizing built-in SQL functions for string manipulation (UPPER, LOWER, SUBSTRING), numeric calculations (ROUND, TRUNCATE), and aggregation (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN).

Aliasing columns and tables for clarity.

Table Joins: Combining data from multiple related tables using INNER JOIN (for matching records) and LEFT JOIN (to include all records from one table, even without matches).

Data Grouping and Filtering Groups: Using GROUP BY with aggregate functions, and HAVING to filter aggregated results.

Subqueries: Employing nested queries to perform complex data retrieval based on dynamic conditions.

Best Practices in SQL Querying:

Readability & Maintainability: Adhering to SQL style conventions (e.g., uppercase for keywords, consistent casing for identifiers, clear indentation, and strategic use of comments).

Performance Optimization: Understanding when to select specific columns over SELECT * to improve query efficiency and resource usage.

Database Setup: The importance of executing DDL scripts to establish the database schema and populate initial data before running DML queries.
